"""
The first of two path parameters in our create_new_cleaning function, new_cleaning, 
is annotated with the CleaningCreate type. 
By default, FastAPI expects the body of a post request directly. 
If we want it to expect JSON with a key new_cleaning and inside of it the model contents,
 we use the special Body parameter embed in the parameter default.

By simply specifying the CleaningCreate Python type declaration for new_cleaning, FastAPI will:

    Read the body of the request as JSON.
    Convert the corresponding types.
    Validate the data.
    Respond with an error if validation fails, or provide the route with the model instance needed.

The second of the two path parameters - cleanings_repo - 
is our database interface, and the route's only dependency. 
We're setting its default to Depends(get_repository(CleaningsRepository)) 
so that we have access to it in our route and can create the new cleaning 
whenever the function is executed. 
FastAPI automatically validates and converts the created_cleaning 
to an instance of our CleaningPublic model, 
and sends the appropriate JSON as a response.
